For example a CC-BY 4.0 license allows a user to share and adapt the work as long as the creator is given appropriate credit. Licensing types may differ based on the type of output (code or a pre-print). \n",
    "3. The repository provides a plan for maintaining longterm access and storage. \n",
    "4. The repository will ensure that data and other scholarly outputs are accessed and used ethically. For example, the repository will not provide access to data that has confidential or private information.\n",
    "5. The repository has financial and personnel backing to ensure its long-term existence.\n",
    "6. The repository will maintain the long term authenticity, by preventing files from becoming corrupted. \n",
    "7. The repository requires a minimum level of metadata to make the scholarship usable and understandable by others.\n",
    "8. The repository assigns identifiers (such as DOIs or ARKs) and generates a citation for long term discovery and accessibility.\n",
    "9. The repository has the proper infrastructure to provide security and ensure the longterm viability of the platform."
